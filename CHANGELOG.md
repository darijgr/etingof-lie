## 0.44

Bugfixes:

  - Some more mistakes corrected, including wrong definitions of "permutation" (for infinite sets) and "Laurent series" (in multiple variables).

## 0.43

Features:

  - Proofs for some basic properties of semiinfinite wedges added (§3.5.4).

Bugfixes:

  - Lots of minor mistakes fixed.

## 0.42

Bugfixes:

  - Wrong argument for well-definedness of power series in §3.11 replaced by correct one. Substantially extended §3.2 for that aim. Also fixed a few other bugs.

## 0.41

Features:

  - Second proof of the formula for `\sigma{-1}` in terms of Schur polynomials (Section 3.14) finalized.

Bugfixes:

  - A few mistakes corrected.

## 0.40

Features:

  - Second proof of the formula for `\sigma{-1}` in terms of Schur polynomials (Section 3.14) written up (will still be extended, but should already be readable).
  - References to sections, theorems, formulas, URLs etc. are now hyperlinks.
  - The section on `\mathbb{Z}`-graded Lie algebras has been extended by formerly missing definitions and examples.

Bugfixes:

  - Wrong notation (z instead of t) in the section on the Virasoro modules `V_{\alpha, \beta}` corrected. Some other errors and inaccuracies removed.

## 0.39

Features:

  - §4.6 has been split into §4.6-4.8 and finished.

Bugfixes:

  - Various errors have been corrected all the way through the notes. The semidirect product is now correctly defined.

## 0.38

Features:

  - §4.6.1 finished.

## 0.37

Features:

  - §4.3 finished.

## 0.36

Bugfixes:

  - A proof in §2.3 corrected.
  - Missing definition of the semidirect product of Virasoro with Heisenberg inserted.

## 0.35

Bugfixes:

  - Minor fixes across the text. More importantly, the action of \overline{a}_{\infty} on the fermionic wedge space is now correctly defined.

## 0.34

Bugfixes:

  - Numerous errors corrected.

## 0.33

Features:

  - Added Section 2.3 about Virasoro modules `V_{\alpha, \beta}`, and made Section 3.8 readable. Hopefully 3.9 and 3.10 also make sense now.

## 0.32

Bugfixes:

  - A minor and a major flaw in the proof of Proposition 2.2.13 corrected.

## 0.31
